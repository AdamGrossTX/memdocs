CMPivot allows you to quickly assess the state of a device in your environment and take action. When you enter a query, CMPivot will run a query in real time on the currently connected device. The data returned can then be filtered, grouped, and refined to answer business questions, troubleshoot issues in your environment, or respond to security threats. For more information about using CMPivot, see [Use CMPivot](../core/servers/manage/cmpivot.md).
