## <a name="bkmk_ipucmd"></a> Remove command prompt during Windows 10 in-place upgrade

<!--2837795-->

During a task sequence to upgrade a device to Windows 10, during one of the final Windows configuration phases a command prompt window opens. The window is on top of the Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE), and users can interact with it to disrupt the upgrade process.

Starting in this release, the SetupCompleteTemplate.cmd and SetupRollbackTemplate.cmd scripts from Configuration Manager include a change to hide the command prompt window.
