## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Azure AD authentication in Software Center

<!-- 6935376 -->

This release fixes an issue with Software Center and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. For a client detected as on the intranet but communicating via the cloud management gateway (CMG), previously Software Center would use Windows authentication. When it tried to get the list of user available apps, it would fail. It now uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity for devices joined to Azure AD. These devices can be cloud-joined or hybrid-joined.
